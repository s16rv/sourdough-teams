## Introduction

### Background

As Web3 and blockchain gain recognition from regulators and major corporations, mass adoption is accelerating — starting in areas like stablecoins and tokenization. To support the shift from traditional finance to on-chain systems, companies will urgently need platforms that make it simple to manage treasuries and move assets efficiently across multiple blockchains.

At Sourdough, we see this as more than just building tools. Our mission is to help facilitate a new global economy powered by blockchain.

## Built on Sourdough Chain

Sourdough Teams is built on the **Sourdough Chain**, a Layer 1 blockchain developed with the Cosmos SDK, leveraging IBC for interoperability and Neutron smart contracts to power advanced multichain functionality.

We consider ourselves multichain by design. Our architecture is built to support seamless interactions not only across Cosmos networks, but also with EVM, Solana, and beyond — giving Sourdough the flexibility to meet assets and communities wherever they are.

## Demo

We built a testnet prototype of Sourdough Teams to demonstrate our vision. We didn’t just aim for something that works, but we aimed for something that feels effortless to use. Every interaction is shaped to be simple, intuitive, and approachable, so teams can focus on their goals, not the complexity of the tech.
